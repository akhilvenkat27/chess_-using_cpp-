# chess_-using_cpp-  


Here is the implementation of chess which was developed in C++.  

Let me divide the total code into few parts.   

**Maps Division:  

I have used various unordered maps which was classified below:  

1) TYPE : It is used for storing type of pieces i.e I assumed type of black as 1 and white 2.    
2) MP : It is used for maintaining movement of pieces.    


**Vector Division:  

1) BOARD (2d) : which is used for displaying Board window.  
2) points_black : Used for maintaning no of pieces gained from white.  
3) points_white : Used for maintaning no of pieces gained from black.  
4) common : maintaninig overall killed pieces.  
5) white_promoted & black_promoted : Used for maitaning the promoting pieces for white & black (not required ! you can display directly the pieces while promotion take place).  

**Functions Division:  

Insertion() : Used for displaying the chess board architecture.  
display() : Used to display current position of board.  
input(): Used for taking input from users both sides.  
 
**Special functions developed:  
1) En passant , Castling , promotion are also developed.  


Note:  
All this requirements are striclty restricted only for my logic you can even write it in more efficient way.
